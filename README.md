Perfect — here’s a first draft for you:  
I'll keep it **clean**, **actionable**, and **easy to follow** like a real project README ✅  
(but you can tell me if you want a second version that's even more checklist-style later!)

# 🧭 Sea Elite Website / Catalogue Build - Step-by-Step Guide

## 📂 1. Project Setup

- [ X ] Initialize a new **Next.js** project
- [ X ] Install **shadcn/ui** for components and styling
- [ X ] Set up **TailwindCSS** (if not bundled already)
- [ ] Create project folder structure:
  - `/components`
  - `/app` (or `/pages` depending on routing)
  - `/public`
  - `/lib` (for utilities/helpers if needed)

---

## 🖥️ 2. Base Pages

- [ ] **Landing page** (Home) - first visual impression
- [ ] **404 page** - custom "Page Not Found" styling
- [ ] **Category listing page** (show all products by default)
- [ ] **Product detail page** (individual product view — optional now if you want MVP first)

---

## 🎨 3. Visual Theme & Branding

- [ ] Set global colors and fonts to match **Sea Elite's** branding
- [ ] Apply consistent padding/margin spacing rules
- [ ] Create reusable UI components:
  - [ ] Navbar
  - [ ] Footer
  - [ ] Category cards
  - [ ] Product cards

---

## 📦 4. Data Structure

- [ ] Decide on **data source**: Static JSON or CMS (ex: Sanity.io / static product list)
- [ ] Create **Product Model** (ex: id, name, price, image, description, tags)
- [ ] Create **Category Model** (ex: id, name, description, slug)

---

## 🔎 5. Dynamic Rendering

- [ ] Map through **products** to display them on the category page
- [ ] Map through **categories** on homepage or navigation
- [ ] Implement dynamic filtering (show only items matching selected category)

---

## 🧹 6. Cleanup and Polish

- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (test small, medium, large devices)
- [ ] SEO basics (title tags, meta descriptions, alt tags for images)
- [ ] Optimize images (webp or compressed jpeg)
- [ ] Test broken links and error pages
- [ ] Add favicon and meta icons

---

## 🚀 7. Launch Preparation

- [ ] Test build locally
- [ ] Deploy to **Vercel** (or preferred host)
- [ ] Set custom domain (optional early, or after launch)

---

# 🏁 Final Note:

> Focus on launching a clean, functioning version first.  
> Visual polish and fancy features (ex: filters, sorting, search) can be layered in _after launch._
